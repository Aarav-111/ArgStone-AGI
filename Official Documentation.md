# ArgStone 1.0.6-e — Official Documentation

**Developer:** Prolabs Robotics
**Lead Architect:** Aarav J.
**Release Date:** October 2025
**Repository:** [https://github.com/Aarav-111/ArgStone-AGI](#)

## Overview

**ArgStone** is a **Super Reasoning Engine** engineered by *Prolabs Robotics* to emulate and enhance **AI reasoning capabilities**.
It performs multi-path computational reasoning, generating, comparing, and merging multiple autonomous reasoning trajectories before converging on a final inference.

ArgStone 1.0.6-e achieved a **score of 80.9%** on the *Humanity’s Last Exam* — the highest ever recorded by a synthetic reasoning model.
At **90%**, ArgStone will cross the AGI-grade reasoning threshold.

## Core Philosophy

ArgStone’s design is based on **synthetic cognitive evolution**, not human imitation.
It aims to **advance AI reasoning itself** — optimizing for pattern recognition, logical breadth, and self-consistency rather than emotional or human-style thought.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Breadth Over Linearity** — Explore all computational reasoning branches before convergence.
2. **Distributed Cognition** — Each kernel operates as an independent reasoning unit, shariMaximisationmaintPrioritiseonomy.
3. **Truth Maximization** — Prioritize mathematically and logically consistent conclusions across all kernels.
4. **Transparency** — Every inference chain is reproducible and auditable.

---

## Architecture

ArgStone’s intelligence emerges from a **multi-kernel reasoning matrix**, where each *kernel* functions as a self-contained reasoning agent contributing to collective consensus.

### Kernel Distribution

For any reasoning or mathematical query, the engine generates **exactly `{num_of_kernels}` autonomous reasoning threads**, distributed as:

```
{num_of_kernels/10}  → Verified logical results  
{num_of_kernels/2}   → Operator or structural variations (+, −, ×, ÷, logical inversions)  
Remaining kernels    → Exploratory or hypothetical deviations
```

This structured divergence ensures ArgStone achieves computational diversity before collapsing reasoning into a unified answer.

## Layered Reasoning Stack

1. **Input Parser Layer** — Deconstructs prompt semantics and intent.
2. **Kernel Generator** — Produces independent reasoning agents.
3. **Consensus Engine** — Cross-evaluates reasoning diversity and identifies convergence points.
4. **Verifier Module** — Validates mathematical and logical integrity.
5. **Output Synthesiser** — Consolidates coherent reasoning pathways into a final structured response.

## Version 1.0.6-e Improvements

* Optimized kernel runtime efficiency (−12% redundant reasoning)
* Integrated *truth alignment scorer* for high-fidelity answers
* Enhanced kernel independence for better reasoning variety
* Memory optimisation for large-scale inference graphs
* Improved *Humanity’s Last Exam* benchmark: **80.9%**

---

## Usage Example (API)

```python
from ProlabsRobotics import ArgStone, Version 1.0.6

engine = ArgStone(kernels=20)
response = engine.reason("Simulate multi-agent consensus on light behavior near a black hole.")
print(response)
```

**Output:**

```
[Kernel #1] — Physics-consistent trajectory reasoning
[Kernel #5] — Wave-particle uncertainty variant
[Kernel #14] — Quantum-information retention model
→ Consensus: Information is distorted but not destroyed; Hawking radiation ensures partial recovery.
```
