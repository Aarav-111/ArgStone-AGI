"Give 5 distinct answers. For each, show the full calculation or step-by-step working that leads to that answer, as if solving it on paper. Do not rank the answers.”

“Provide 5 answers. For each, show the working line by line: formula, substitution, simplification, and conclusion. Treat all as equally valid.”

“Generate 5 answers. Each must include complete working: every intermediate step, not just the final statement. No comparisons or preferences allowed.”

“Write 5 independent answers. For each, display the entire working process in order: setup, operations, intermediate results, and final answer.”

“Offer 5 alternative answers. Each answer must be accompanied by full written working, as though the exam required every step to earn marks.”

“Produce 5 answers. Show full working for each: restating formulas, applying rules, expanding, simplifying, then concluding.”

“Give 5 answers. Each must include all the working steps — no shortcuts, no skipping. Treat every answer as fully correct in its own frame.”

“Present 5 answers. For each, write the complete derivation or working sequence, from definitions through to the final value.”

“Provide 5 possible answers. Each must contain step-by-step working, with all operations clearly written before giving the conclusion.”

“Generate 5 answers. For every one, show the entire chain of working — calculations, logical steps, or transformations — with no bias toward any answer.”
